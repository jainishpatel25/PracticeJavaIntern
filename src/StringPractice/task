🔹 Beginner Level
Reverse a string without using built-in functions.
Count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
Check if a string is a palindrome.
Find the length of a string without using len() or similar functions.
Convert a string to uppercase and lowercase manually.
Count the frequency of each character in a string.

🔹 Intermediate Level
Remove all duplicate characters from a string.
Find the first non-repeating character in a string.
Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
Replace all spaces in a string with -.
Find the longest word in a sentence.
Count the number of words in a string.

🔹 Advanced Level
Implement a function to check if a string contains only digits.
Find the longest palindrome substring in a given string.
Write a program to rotate a string (e.g., "abcde" → "deabc").
Find all permutations of a string.
Implement substring search without using built-in functions (indexOf, find, etc.).
Compress a string using run-length encoding (e.g., "aaabbc" → "a3b2c1").




🔹 Possible Variations of the Question
Remove duplicates but keep them sorted
Instead of preserving the original order, output characters in alphabetical order.
Example: "programming" → "agimnoprst".
Remove duplicates but keep only the last occurrence
Instead of keeping the first time a character appears, keep the last.
Example: "jaaainiishhh" → "anish".
Remove duplicates case-insensitively
Treat uppercase and lowercase as the same.
Example: "JavaJAVAj" → "jav".
Remove duplicates and count frequency simultaneously
Output both the unique characters and how many times they appeared.
Example: "jaaainiishhh" → j(1) a(4) i(3) n(1) s(1) h(3).
Remove duplicates but only for vowels/consonants
Keep all consonants but remove duplicate vowels (or vice versa).
Example: "jaaainiishhh" → "jains h" (unique vowels only).
Remove duplicates without using extra strings
Do it directly on a character array, modifying it in place.
This tests your ability to work with arrays and indexes.
Remove duplicates from words in a sentence
Instead of characters, remove duplicate words.
Example: "this is is a test test" → "this is a test".
